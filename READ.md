# Water Quality Prediction for Concrete Mixing

This project is part of an AI & Edge Programming internship. The goal is to predict whether a given water sample is **good** or **bad** for use in concrete mixing using various machine learning models.

## 🔍 Project Description

Using a dataset of water samples with features like pH, Chloride, Solids, Sulphate, etc., we train multiple models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.) and evaluate them using performance metrics and visualizations.

## 📁 Files Included

- `water_quality_analysis.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook with EDA, ML training, evaluation, and feature importance.
- `water_potability.csv` – Dataset used for training and testing.
- `README.md` – This file.
- `.gitignore` – Ignores unnecessary files like `.ipynb_checkpoints/`.

## 📊 ML Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- SVM, Naive Bayes, etc. *(optional)*

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Cross-Validation
